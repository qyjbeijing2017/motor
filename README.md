# Motor

Have you ever tried serializing and saving the entire current state of a software program, only to restore it the next time you open it? Have you experienced your phone’s app being cleared by the system due to insufficient resources, forcing you to reopen the web page you were browsing? Have you ever considered enabling a program to seamlessly switch to another device and continue your unfinished work? Or perhaps you want a program that can autonomously navigate the web world? All these needs can be fulfilled by Motor – a project focused on creating programs with floating contexts.

Motor works by preserving the program’s stack, heap, registers, and other information in a fixed section of memory. It separates the program’s fixed and non-fixed data, enabling the suspension, transfer, and distribution of non-fixed contexts during runtime. This approach allows for the rapid realization of the aforementioned goals.
